# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/montserrat/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
        # - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
        # style: italic
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/roboto/Roboto-Medium.ttf
          # - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
